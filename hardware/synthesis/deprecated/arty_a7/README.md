# Saxon on Arty A7-35

This guide shows the step to program the FPGA bit file and the SPI flash.
With that you just get u-boot running. To boot linux you need further steps, see
https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SaxonSoc/tree/dev/bsp/Arty7Linux

NOTE: you will need a sdcard Pmod module to boot linux https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-microsd-microsd-card-slot/

## Before Starting

You should make sure you have the following tools installed:
 * vivado 2018.1 or later
 * riscv toolchain (riscv64-unknown-elf)
 * sbt

## Board setup
Make sure you have a rev E board. If you have a later version check that the
flash part is S25FL128SAGMF100.

Jumper settings for board rev E:
 * Disconnect anything from the connectors (Pmod, Arduino)
 * Jumpers: JP1 and JP2 on, others off.

## Repo setup
You need to do this once to get dependencies.

WARNING: this create u-boot directory aside of the SaxonSoc directory

```sh
cd hardware/synthesis/arty_a7
make repo-setup
```

## Building

### SPI flash software
```sh
cd hardware/synthesis/arty_a7
make spi-flash-sw
```

### Hardware (and bootloader)
```sh
cd hardware/synthesis/arty_a7
make
```

You should get output similar to this
```
mkdir -p build

```

The process should take around 8 minutes on a reasonably fast computer.

## Programming

### QSPI flash programming (load hardware + u-boot)

Run `make flash` to program the bit file to the QSPI flash.

You should get output like the following;
```

```

After programming the software starts and send some output on the uart.
NOTE: the RESET button is not connected to the design. To reboot, use the
 "PROG" button on the board. Then after a second or so the "DONE" LED shall be
 ON and something shall be sent on the uart.


### Direct FPGA RAM programming (update only hardware for quick test)

Run `make prog` to program the bit file directly to FPGA RAM.
Next time you power up the board the FPGA RAM will be reloaded with content from
QSPI flash so remember that anything loaded using this method is only temporary.

You should get output like the following;
```

    ** Copyright 1986-2018 Xilinx, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

WARNING: [Labtools 27-3361] The debug hub core was not detected.
Resolution:
1. Make sure the clock connected to the debug hub (dbg_hub) core is a free running clock and is active.
2. Make sure the BSCAN_SWITCH_USER_MASK device property in Vivado Hardware Manager reflects the user scan chain setting in the design and refresh the device.  To determine the user scan chain setting in the design, open the implemented design and use 'get_property C_USER_SCAN_CHAIN [get_debug_cores dbg_hub]'.
For more details on setting the scan chain property, consult the Vivado Debug and Programming User Guide (UG908).

```

After programming the bootloader included in the bit file is started
(no visual feedback of any kind).
It shall launch the software installed in the QSPI flash.

### SD card Programming
Identify the sdcard in your system, usually something like `sdb` or `mmcblk0`.
One way is to insert it and type `dmesg|tail`:
```
user@lafite:~/Downloads/SaxonSoc/hardware/synthesis/arty_a7$ dmesg|tail
[14396.176825] sd 1:0:0:0: [sdb] Mode Sense: 03 00 00 00
[14396.176965] sd 1:0:0:0: [sdb] No Caching mode page found
[14396.176973] sd 1:0:0:0: [sdb] Assuming drive cache: write through
[14396.179585]  sdb: sdb1 sdb2
[14396.181975] sd 1:0:0:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI removable disk
[14396.633059] EXT4-fs (sdb1): mounting ext2 file system using the ext4 subsystem
[14396.641204] EXT4-fs (sdb1): mounted filesystem without journal. Opts: (null)
[14396.650952] EXT4-fs (sdb2): mounting ext2 file system using the ext4 subsystem
[14396.652644] EXT4-fs (sdb2): warning: mounting unchecked fs, running e2fsck is recommended
[14396.656826] EXT4-fs (sdb2): mounted filesystem without journal. Opts: (null)
```
So here the sdcard is `sdb`. Program it as follow:
```
make sdcard SDCARD=sdb
```

## Connect

After programming you should be able to connect to the serial port and have some output.

On Linux you can do this using a command like `screen /dev/ttyUSB1`. Other good alternatives:

* moserial (GUI)
* picocom (can be launched via the file "picocom_arty")

Parameters:
* port is        : /dev/ttyUSB1
* flowcontrol    : none
* baudrate is    : 115200
* parity is      : none
* databits are   : 8
* stopbits are   : 1

Output when no sdcard is present:
```
